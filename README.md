# Candid Public License

> Encouraging copyleft within organizations and supporting the sustainability of open source software.

Candid Public License (CPL) is a modified version of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL).  It's intent is to encourage organizations to open source software that depends on or operates work covered by the CPL, or negotiate a separate license for the work.

The AGPL was originally created to help users of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) receive the source code for modified works as the GNU General Public License (GPL) did not qualify network interaction as distribution.

The CPL builds upon the AGPL to create an infectious copyleft requirement for all software that depends upon the work or builds/operates the work.  For organizations that are already source available, this change shouldn't impact them.  For other organizations, they will need to release the source code for the dependent software.  They may also negotiate a separate license to use the work.
